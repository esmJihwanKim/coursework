Class Project @SKKU <br/>

## *Project Overview*
--------------------------------------------
> #### Main focus was to develop an Android app that uses numerous device drivers written for hardware connected to device's CPU. This was done through the help of JNI(Java Native Interface) that links the C part of the device driver and the application code in Java language. The key hardware components for this application are as follows:
>  * Exynos M1 FPGA
>  * LED connected to FPGA  
>  * Key Buttons connected to FPGA 
>  * Dot Matrix connected to FPGA 
>  * 7-Segment connected to FPGA
